# 📊 Data Science Internship – Task 2

## 📝 Introduction
This repository contains my work for **Task 2** of the *Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship*.  
For this task, I performed **data cleaning** 🧹 and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** 🔍 on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The [`Titanic dataset`](https://github.com/TithiShah009/PRODIGY_DS_02/blob/main/Titanic_Dataset.csv) is a classic dataset in data science.  
It contains details about Titanic passengers, including demographics and survival status.  
This dataset is widely used for learning and is perfect for practicing data cleaning and visualization techniques.

---

## 🎯 Task Description
The main goals for this task were:
- Clean the dataset by handling **missing values** and **duplicates**.
- Perform **exploratory analysis** to find relationships between variables.
- Identify **patterns and trends** in passenger survival.

---

## 📊 Analysis Highlights
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning** – Filled missing values, handled null entries, and removed irrelevant columns.
- 📈 **Relationship Exploration** – Studied survival rates by **gender**, **passenger class**, **age**, and **fare**.
- 💡 **Key Insights** –  
  - Females had a higher survival rate.  
  - 1st-class passengers survived more often than 3rd-class passengers.  
  - Younger passengers had slightly higher survival chances.  

---

## 📌 Conclusion
Through this analysis, I discovered valuable insights into the factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster 🚢.  
This project demonstrates how data science techniques can turn historical data into meaningful knowledge.
